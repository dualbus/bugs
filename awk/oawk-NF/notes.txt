* Segmentation fault occurs because awk tries to getsval a 'vp', but
  that vp hasn't been initialized.

    'NF = 10; print'

* The problem is that nawk sets NF, but it doesn't grow
  (lib.c:growfldtab) the field table.

* One solution would be to grow the field table when NF is updated.
  nawk already does something like this when you do $fld = "", it
  call's lib.c:newfld when a field is set via setfval/setsval.

* I don't like the patch's function name. Also, I feel it's not
  complete. In what other ways we can increase NF without re-growing
  the field table?
